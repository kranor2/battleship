This is my fourteenth project within the Full Stack JavaScript course from The Odin Project, continuing my coursework within the JavaScript chapter of the course. This project responds to the prompt wherein students are challenged to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) in JavaScript in a project setting, building a web-based version of the tabletop game, Battleship, to play against the computer/browser.

At this time, I am placing this project on hiatus, and choosing not to deploy for now. I may return to finish bringing it to functionality in time. The main goal of the project, as stated above, was to practice TDD in a project (as opposed to exercises), which I have done effectively.
